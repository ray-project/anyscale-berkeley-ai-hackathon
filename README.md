## Overview

LLMs have gained immense popularity in recent months. An entirely new ecosystem of pre-trained models and tools has emerged that streamline the process of building LLM-based applications.

Here, you will build question answering (QA) service designed to run locally. You will learn how to scale your application using Ray and Anyscale to run it in the cloud. Finally, you will learn how to use modern tools to run your application on the production-grade platform.

## Key Takeaways

* Use libraries like Ray, HuggingFace, and LangChain to build LLM-based applications based on open-source code, models, and data.
* Learn about scaling LLM fine-tuning and inference, along with trade-offs.
* Use embedding models and vector stores.
* Learn about using modern deployment tools to run your application online and continually improve it.
